# From the shell of a debian container, install via the 
# containerâ€™s package manager everything you need to compile C 
# source code and push it onto a git repo (ofcourse, make sure 
# before that the package manager and the packages already in thecontainer are updated). 
# For this exercise, you should only specify the commands to be run directly in the container.

docker pull debian
docker run --name deb -it --rm debian
